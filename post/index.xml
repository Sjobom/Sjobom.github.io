      <description>Me and some friends went on a road trip to Colorado to do some winter hiking! We traveled from Urbana to Estes park for 1700 km on a single day. We hiked for 4 days sleeping in tents and walking with snowshoes. It was a truly great experience, even though the nights were a bit cold.</description>

      <description>In the fall of 2018 I will study at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign! I have been accepted into an exchange program via my home university KTH who has UIUC as a partner university. I am really looking forward to experience the american university culture!</description>
